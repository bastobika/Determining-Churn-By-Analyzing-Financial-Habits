In this project, I have used artificial data from a bank to determine whether a customer from the bank is likely to churn or not. I have used various data visualization techniques like histograms,pie charts and correlation matrices to visualize the data. I have built an Aritifical Neural Network classifier model to solve this problem. I have used K-fold classification to find the actual accuracy of the model. I also have tried to improve the accuracy by parameter tuning.
